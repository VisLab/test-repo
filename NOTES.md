##### Merge process
Update process:  
   1.  Fork the hed-standard/hed-specification repository in your own github account.  
   2.  Clone this repository locally and create a new branch.
   3.  Make your changes and then push to that new branch on your own repository.
   4.  When you are done, do a pull request for hed-specification to the actual repository on hed-standard.  
   5.  Ask for reviews. 
   6.  When all reviewers have approved, the administrator will merge to the master branch of hed-standard.
