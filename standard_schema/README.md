# HED standard schema

### HED schema version 8.2.0 was released 4/28/2023.

**Note** This repository is primarily for managing the HED vocabulary. If you just 
want to annotate your data, please visit the [**HED resources**](https://www.hed-resources.org) documentation website. 

The full HED specification is available at the
[**HED specification**](https://hed-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) website. 

## What is HED?
HED is an evolving framework for the description and formal annotation of events 
identified in time series data. The HED ecosystem includes a structured vocabulary (HED schema)
together with tools for validation and for using HED annotations in data search, 
extraction, and analysis. While HED can be used to annotate any type of event, 
the current HED community focuses on annotation of events in human 
electrophysiological and behavioral data such as EEG, MEG, iEEG, eye-tracking, 
motion-capture, EKG, and audiovisual recording.
See [**HED resources**](https://www.hed-resources.org/en/latest/) for
additional information, tutorials, and links to resources.
See the [**hed-schemas README**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-schemas/blob/main/README.md) for more detailed information
about versioning, availability, and other information.

## Role of the standard schema
The purpose of the HED standard schema is to provide a standardized 
annotation vocabulary that is generally applicable for most neuroimaging
and behavioral experiments. More specialized terms can be available by
extending tag paths in the standard schema or, if available, by using
terms from more specialized vocabularies.
