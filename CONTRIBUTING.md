## Guidelines for contributing

HED (Hierarchical Event Descriptors) is an open community and contributions to all aspects of HED are welcome.
All HED repositories are housed in the [hed-standard](https://github.com/hed-standard) GitHub organization.
The HED Working Group meets regularly to oversee the development of HED and its ecosystem.
If you would like to join the HED Working Group or wish to contact them directly
please email [mailto:hed.maintainers@gmail.com](mailto:hed.maintainers@gmail.com).

Most contributions to HED are initiated through the GitHub issue mechanism.
Here are suggested approaches for contributions in various categories.

### New term to existing schema 
To propose a new term for a HED schema, post issue to 
[**hed-schemas**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-schemas/issues) listing (as much as possible):
- the schema, 
- term
- potential parent
- background and reasons 
- links to existing similar terms in other ontologies or vocabularies
- examples of usage

### Corrections to existing term

To propose corrections/changes to description, attributes, units allowed, value classes for an
existing term post an issue to [**hed-schemas**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-schemas/issues). List:
- the schema, 
- term
- change details
- background and reasons 

Deprecation of a term is a more major change and requires much additional consideration.

### Propose a new HED library schema
To propose a new HED vocabulary for a subfield, post an issue to 
[**hed-schemas**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-schemas/issues) 
indicating your interest. List:
- the proposed name of the schema
- the subfield
- the need for the vocabulary
- how it relates to the standard schema and other library schemas
- proposer group members
- email [mailto:hed.maintainers@gmail.com](mailto:hed.maintainers@gmail.com) with contact information.

You should also read over the 
[**HED schema developer's guide**](https://www.hed-resources.org/en/latest/HedSchemaDevelopersGuide.html).
The HED Working Group will arrange a meeting to discuss the development of the library schema.

### Corrections to documentation and bug reports

Corrections and documentation can be posted to [**hed-schemas**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-schemas/issues), 
and they will be forwarded to the correct repository.
